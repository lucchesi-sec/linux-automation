# Security Policy

## Overview

The Linux Automation System implements comprehensive security scanning and monitoring to ensure the safety and integrity of the system administration automation tools.

## Security Architecture

### Runtime Security
The system includes robust runtime security monitoring through:
- **Daily Security Audits**: Comprehensive system security assessments
- **File Permission Monitoring**: Critical system file permission validation
- **Process Security Scanning**: Detection of suspicious processes and network connections
- **Configuration Compliance**: SSH, firewall, and system security configuration validation
- **Vulnerability Management**: Automated scanning for security updates and vulnerabilities

### Build-Time Security
Automated security scanning is performed on every code change:
- **Shell Script Analysis**: Static analysis using ShellCheck for security vulnerabilities
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Filesystem scanning using Trivy for known vulnerabilities
- **Secret Detection**: GitLeaks scanning to prevent credential exposure
- **Python Security**: Bandit analysis for Python security issues (when applicable)

## Security Scanning Workflow

### Automated Scans
Security scans are triggered on:
- Every push to the main branch
- All pull requests
- Daily scheduled scans (3:15 AM UTC)

### Scan Types

#### 1. ShellCheck Analysis
- **Purpose**: Static analysis of shell scripts for security and quality issues
- **Scope**: All `.sh` files in `scripts/`, `modules/`, and `core/` directories
- **Configuration**: `.shellcheckrc`

#### 2. Trivy Vulnerability Scanning
- **Purpose**: Detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies and filesystems
- **Scope**: Entire repository filesystem
- **Severity**: Critical and High severity issues
- **Configuration**: Built-in vulnerability database

#### 3. Secret Detection
- **Purpose**: Prevent accidental commit of sensitive information
- **Tool**: GitLeaks
- **Scope**: All files and commit history
- **Configuration**: `.gitleaks.toml`

#### 4. Python Security Analysis
- **Purpose**: Security analysis of Python scripts (if present)
- **Tool**: Bandit
- **Scope**: All `.py` files
- **Configuration**: `.bandit`

## Security Reporting

### GitHub Security Tab
All security findings are reported to GitHub's Security tab using SARIF format for:
- Centralized vulnerability tracking
- Integration with GitHub Advanced Security features
- Historical trend analysis

### Pull Request Comments
Security scan results are automatically commented on pull requests, providing:
- Summary of security findings
- Tool-specific issue counts
- Overall security status

### Issue Creation
Critical security findings automatically create GitHub issues with:
- Detailed security assessment
- Remediation recommendations
- Links to relevant documentation

## Security Standards and Compliance

### Shell Script Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper quoting and variable handling
- Secure file permission management
- Safe command execution patterns

### File and Directory Security
- Restricted access to sensitive configuration files
- Secure temporary file handling
- Proper logging and audit trails

### Network Security
- SSH configuration hardening
- Firewall management
- Network connection monitoring

## Vulnerability Management

### Severity Classification
- **Critical**: Immediate security threats requiring urgent attention
- **High**: Significant security issues requiring prompt resolution
- **Medium**: Moderate security concerns for scheduled resolution
- **Low**: Minor security improvements for future consideration

### Response Timeline
- **Critical**: Immediate response (within 4 hours)
- **High**: Response within 24 hours
- **Medium**: Response within 1 week
- **Low**: Response within 1 month

## Reporting Security Issues

### Responsible Disclosure
If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Send details to the project maintainers privately
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested remediation (if applicable)

### Security Contact
- Create a private vulnerability report through GitHub Security Advisories
- Use encrypted communication when possible

## Security Configuration

### Runtime Security Configuration
The system's runtime security is configured through:
- `config/bash-admin.json`: Main configuration file
- Security audit scripts in `modules/system/`
- Daily administration scripts in `scripts/administration/`

### Build-Time Security Configuration
Security scanning tools are configured via:
- `.shellcheckrc`: ShellCheck static analysis rules
- `.gitleaks.toml`: Secret detection patterns and allowlists
- `.bandit`: Python security analysis configuration

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors
- Follow secure coding practices for shell scripts
- Validate all user inputs
- Use absolute paths where possible
- Implement proper error handling
- Never commit sensitive information
- Test security configurations before submission

### For Administrators
- Regularly review security audit reports
- Keep systems updated with security patches
- Monitor security scan results
- Implement proper access controls
- Maintain secure backup procedures

## Security Monitoring

### Continuous Monitoring
The system provides continuous security monitoring through:
- Automated daily security audits
- Real-time security alerting
- Comprehensive security reporting
- Integration with system logging

### Metrics and KPIs
Security effectiveness is measured through:
- Number of security issues detected and resolved
- Time to remediate security vulnerabilities
- Security scan coverage and success rates
- Compliance with security standards

## Updates and Maintenance

This security policy is reviewed and updated:
- Quarterly for general updates
- Immediately following security incidents
- When new security tools or standards are adopted
- Based on security audit recommendations
