## ‚ú® Features

This toolkit provides a wide range of features to automate Linux system administration:

-   **User Management**: Scripts for adding, deleting, and managing user accounts.
-   **Backup Management**: Tools to initiate and verify system backups.
-   **Package Management**: Automated checks for package updates and system upgrades.
-   **Process & Service Monitoring**: Monitor critical system processes and services to ensure they are running correctly.
-   **System Health Checks**: Perform regular health checks on the system's resources (CPU, memory, disk space).
-   **Security Auditing**: Run daily security audits to identify potential vulnerabilities.
-   **Log Management**: Automated log rotation, compression, and cleanup.
-   **Daily Administration Suite**: A master script that runs all daily checks and tasks in a coordinated manner.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This guide will help you get started with the Linux Daily Administration Automation toolkit.

### Prerequisites

-   Linux system (Ubuntu 18.04+, CentOS 7+, or similar)
-   Bash 4.0 or higher
-   Root or sudo privileges for system administration tasks

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lucchesi-sec/linux-automation.git
    cd linux-automation
    ```

2.  **Set Permissions**:
    Make all scripts executable.
    ```bash
    find . -name "*.sh" -exec chmod +x {} \;
    ```

3.  **Initialize Configuration**:
    Copy the example configuration file. You will need to edit this file to match your environment.
    ```bash
    sudo cp config/config.json.example config/config.json
    ```

### Quick Start

To run the complete daily administration suite:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/administration/daily_admin_suite.sh
```

## üíª Usage

### Running the Full Suite

The most common use case is to run the entire suite of administrative scripts. This can be scheduled as a cron job to run daily.

```bash
sudo ./scripts/administration/daily_admin_suite.sh
```

### Running Individual Scripts

You can also run individual scripts for specific tasks. For example, to run only the security audit:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/administration/daily_security_audit.sh
```

Or to perform disk cleanup:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/maintenance/disk_cleanup.sh
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All scripts are configured through the central `config/config.json` file. This file allows you to set parameters for logging, notifications, backup paths, and more.

For a detailed explanation of all configuration options, please see the [Configuration Reference](docs/configuration.md).
